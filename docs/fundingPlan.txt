If we get a funding at some point:

- we will get max 20e/h based on working hours.

Example:
We get a funding of 15000e
Petri has done 300 hours
Joe has done 350 hours
Juho has done 50 hours

Petri gets 300x20 = 6000e
Joe gets 350x20 = 7000e
Juho gets 50x20 = 1000e

Our "company" will get 15000e - (6000e + 7000e + 1000e) = 1000e;

(note: if we decide to found a company, we will use 2500 to the founding which will be taken off from the funding before dividing profits)

Company money will be used for:
- office rent & stuff
- founding a company


At some point if our company starts to get more profit, we can raise our 20e/h salary.

if we sell the company to google for example with some huge deal

OR

if we somehow manage to get 1mil profit to the company bank and the company isn't making profit and we decide to take the company down

we divide the profits to ourselves based on:
- based on working hours, max 8h / day, 5 times per week

Lastly,

if we reach some point, lets say 1mil, we no longer can raise the profit % because we have hired 
people to work for us. And if we sell/or stop the company; needs to be decided later in the future if we cant make agreement, goes based on hours

options are:

1. based on hours

2. we agree and lock % that everyone gets BUT if some of us wants to make money, we can raise his salary but it doesnt affect to the % that he gets from the company profit.
