Could not make docker work yet. I'll leave the file here though in case we will use it in the future

Docker commands:
List docker processes: docker ps   | example output:

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
932a729dd70f        friendlyhello       "python app.py"     5 seconds ago       Up 5 seconds        0.0.0.0:1337->80/tcp   elegant_albattani

View the logs:
docker logs <container id>

Stop a process:
docker stop elegant_albattani   | notice that elegant_albattani is the name of the process from the last column labeled "NAMES"

Remove dangling docker images from taking space:
docker image prune
