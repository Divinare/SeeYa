MIGRATIONS: http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/1.7.0/docs/migrations/ -To start using migrations, run commands:

::: npm install -g sequelize-cli

This command creates a migration folder
::: sequelize init:migrations

-Create migration file, for example:

::: sequelize migration:create --name add-time-to-event

To run all of the pending migrations, enter

::: sequelize db:migrate

To undo the latest migration, enter

::: sequelize db:migrate:undo

To undo all of the migrations, enter

::: sequelize db:migrate:undo:all



Tip: if migration is not working, add all of the fields of a model to the migration (even those that are not going to be changed!)
