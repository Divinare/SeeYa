We are using currently using:
psql (PostgreSQL) 9.4.4

Connects to postgres:
sudo -u postgres psql

Connects to database:
psql -d devdb

Connects to database devdb as user general:
psql -U general devdb

If not working, try these:
psql -h localhost -U postgres
\connect devdb

Drops a database:
DROP DATABASE devdb;

Creates a database:
CREATE DATABASE devdb;

List all tables:
\d
\d+
\l+

DATABASE management:

We do this by using dump files, read documentation: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/backup-dump.html

EXPORT

Connect to posgres first
Create a dumpfile of a dabatase, outfile = some output filename:
pg_dump -Fc devdb > seedsdb.dump

IMPORT

REMEMBER to change your username, db and the right .dump file
pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U joe -d devdb seedsdb.dump

pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U Pete -d devdb seedsdb.dump

pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U admin -d devdb seedsdb.dump



To move DB to the production:





LINUX

To restart postgres:
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart




USER RIGHTS

Lists roles of users:
\du

Adding a user general with password:

psql -h localhost -U postgres

CREATE USER general WITH PASSWORD 'random123';
REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE devdb FROM PUBLIC;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE devdb TO general;

\connect devdb

Gives privileges for user general for all the tables of the current database:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO general;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public to general;


If you get an error when doing migrations it may be because you have used different user to create the database than what sequelize is using to connect to the database. You can either change the connection settings in config.json or you can do the following:
log in to psql in devdb database as postgres user and run this

REASSIGN OWNED BY "Pete" TO general;  //assuming Pete was the user that was used to create the database and general is the on you want to give the ownership to
You can use \d when logged into devdb to view the relations and their owners

If you already ran the migration sequelize may claim migrations are up to date. Undo the latest migration and redo it, that should work.
