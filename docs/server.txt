Server ip: 37.139.24.156

CONNECT:
The following command assumes that you have a private key called seeya in the same folder where you are running
the command from. The public key has to be configured to the server.

ssh -i seeya general@37.139.24.156

if you want to use the default key (id_rsa), you can just use this command

ssh general@37.139.24.156


HOW TO START THE APP ON THE SERVER:
- When the server reboots it should automatically restart the app. If this doesn't happen or you have to start or stop the app when you are doing an upgrade for example you can use the following commands (notice that you might need to run the commands from the EventMeetup folder, not sure if it is necessary):

pm2 start gulp
Starts the app. If this is not working and says that gulpfile cannot be found you can run pm2 delete <id> (see below), and try to start again. After starting the app you should run pm2 save, this will tell pm2 to restart all the processes currently ran by pm2 on server reboot.

pm2 list 
This command will show the processes that have been started by using pm2 (a program we use to manage running our app). So if you ran the pm2 start gulp first, you should now see something like this:

        ┌──────────┬────┬──────┬──────┬────────┬─────────┬────────┬──────────────┬──────────┐                    │ App name │ id │ mode │ pid  │ status │ restart │ uptime │ memory       │ watching │                    ├──────────┼────┼──────┼──────┼────────┼─────────┼────────┼──────────────┼──────────┤                    │ gulp     │ 0  │ fork │ 1096 │ online │ 0       │ 11h    │ 134.199 MB   │ disabled │                    └──────────┴────┴──────┴──────┴────────┴─────────┴────────┴──────────────┴──────────┘    
In the id column you see the id used by pm2 to identify the process.

pm2 stop <id>
Can be used to stop the app. The id part of the command is the id you see when you run pm2 list. So usually pm2 stop 0 should stop our app since we don't at least currently use pm2 for anything else. 

pm2 delete <id>
Will remove process from pm2 list. You might need this command sometimes if pm2 start gulp is not working properly

pm2 logs
See the logs of processes currently managed by pm2

More info for example here: http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/ and in google!



To restart pm in production:

pm2 stop 0
pm2 delete 0
pm2 start gulp (run at eventMeetup folder)

USERS: root, general
The password for the general user is seeyaServer0104 (in case you need to do commands that need super user privileges)

ssh access to root account has been disabled for security reasons according to the instructions here:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04
the user general can use commands that need super user privileges by using sudo before the command.

NOTICE:
- About ram: The current server only has 512 mb ram available, and also 1gb swap file (will be used if we run out of ram. The swap file was set up according to the instructions here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-on-ubuntu-14-04). If the ram is not enough we should probably upgrade the server to a bigger one, the next tier is 10 dollars (plus VAT)/month with 1gb of ram. If we do a flexible upgrade, we can later go back to the cheaper server. 

- About the server configuration: The server has a nginx reverse proxy installed. This means that our users connect to nginx and nginx forwards the connections to our app in port 1337. The configuration has been done according to instructions here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-14-04
Config file for nginx can be found from /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

- Postgres:
The production server has a NODE_ENV=production set as suggested by this website: http://www.hacksparrow.com/running-express-js-in-production-mode.html
So in the production the database is accessed by the general user whereas in development mode there are no passwords needed.

TODO:
- We should probably enable https and we might need an ssl certificate for that. Instructions can be found from here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-an-ssl-certificate-from-a-commercial-certificate-authority
We should be able to get a certificate for free for a year from namecheap with the student developer pack.
