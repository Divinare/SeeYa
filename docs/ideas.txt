List ideas here that arent implented yet:


### Overall ###

- Small window somewhere which contains some history of the latest events viewed.
   * cookies could use this


### EventList ###
- Next to address: icon to center on map
- Click on address to open popup that contains city and city code and "click to show on map" -button
- when event is created


### Map ###
- Make map bigger

- Right click -> open menu
   the menu would have:
   	  - Create event here
   	  - "Search for events around here"
   	  - Zoom
   	  - etc.
   ^ how can this be done in mobile version?

### EventForm ###

- Animation when address is filled
- When going back to frontpage, create event here marker disappears?
