List ideas here that arent implented yet:


### Overall ###

- Small window somewhere which contains some history of the latest events viewed.
   * cookies could use this

- Some quick search settings for users. For example fills search properties automatically "Category: baseball, time: 0d-10d from now, Address: near current location"


### Users ###

- User rewards
	- if user gets from his shared link 3-5 people to join and create account he could get some bonus or profit

### EventList ###
- Next to address: icon to center on map
- Click on address to open popup that contains city and city code and "click to show on map" -button
- when event is created


### Map ###
- "Button to zoom out / center map location to where user is by using GPS"

- Right click -> open menu
   the menu would have:
   	  - Create event here
   	  - "Search for events around here"
   	  - Zoom
   	  - etc.
   ^ how can this be done in mobile version? <- We need to implement whole new eventList to the mobile version. Maybe at this point make eventList by ourselves

- Events of user shows with his own color

- At google maps streetview, make markers bigger and clickable

- Event's location could be updated by the creator by dragging and dropping

### EventForm ###

- Animation when address is filled
- When going back to frontpage, create event here marker disappears?
