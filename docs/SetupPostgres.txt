Instructions to get postgres running on your local environment:

1. Install postgres in your system (maybe it is enough also to install with npm install but I googled it.. maybe http://www.postgresql.org/download/)

2. Put postgres bin folder in your path so that you can use psql from command line (needed at least on windows)

3. Create the database and database role with following commands:
(replace "Pete" in the second command with the name that is needed in your system. If you try to run gulp before creating the role, you should get error message telling that something like that a role "xyz" has not been defined, where "xyz" was "Pete" in my system)

CREATE DATABASE devdb;
CREATE ROLE "Pete" WITH LOGIN;
ALTER USER Pete PASSWORD 'insert password here';

4. Update pg_hba.conf, which should be located in postgres installation directory in data folder

- You need to modify the rows on the bottom. My file's bottom looks like this: 
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
#host    replication     postgres        127.0.0.1/32            md5
#host    replication     postgres        ::1/128                 md5

basically this means that anyone can connect with IPv4 and IPv6 local connections without a password

Now you should be finished. Running gulp should work.



LINUX/Ubuntu

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo -i -u postgres

postgres@desktop:~$ createuser -P joe
--> enter password

postgres@desktop:~$ createdb -O joe devdb

CREATE DATABASE devdb;
CREATE ROLE "joe" WITH LOGIN;
ALTER USER joe PASSWORD 'insert password here';

configure file pg_hba.conf at:
/etc/postgresql/9.4/main

Find line:
local   all             all                                     peer

Insert this line above that^ line:
local   all             all                                     md5

Save the file and then restart postgresql:
joe@joe-All-Series:~/EventMeetup$ sudo service postgresql restart
