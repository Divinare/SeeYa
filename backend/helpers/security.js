/*
We use salt and key stretching to make sure users' passwords are safe.
Salt prevents the attackers from using lookup tables.
Key stretching makes it too expensive to do dictionary or brute-force attacks.
Note that key stretching makes us more vulnerable for DoS attacks, so in case this ever becomes a problem,
we might need to reconsider if we want to use key stretching or lower the iteration count at least.

One way to decrease the burden on server side could also be to use client side hashing, but that has its own things
to consider, see https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm 

Ideas have been taken from these sources:
